# SpinlabBits
Random hardware bits to help with human hyperpolarised experiments. 

A draft ArXiV paper will be released soon for this work -- if it's helpful to you, please cite it! 

Briefly, this repository contains (at present): 


1. LaserWelderSpacer -- a thin, difficult to manufacture titanium ring that ensures that the SFP sample cup is always laser welded at the appropriate location. Contact me (jack.miller@physics.org) to arrange manufacture through the University of Oxford Department of Physics if required. 
1. SFP Double Split Clamp -- a holder for the Part A syringe, designed to go on a standard retort stand 
1. SFP Holder Base -- the base of a standard retort stand but with an added cup to hold the sample vial 
1. SFP Puller Tool -- a tool to pull medrad syringes up. It slides in, rotates to lock, and has a threaded insert for a handle. 
1. SFP Pusher Tool -- another tool to push out the fill plug from the syringe. This is a little undersized deliberately. 
1. SFP Syringe Holder -- a Part B receiving vessel syringe holding device that clamps on a standard 10 mm retort stand pole. The forks fit through the part B base, and the hole is for a clevis pin. 

Other information will be added "soon".
